# CasaOS Custom Icons by taikun114
**English** | [日本語](docs/README-ja.md)

This is a repository of custom icons for use with [CasaOS](https://casaos.io/).

They are few icons as they are mainly made for my use, but if you want to have an icon added, please open an Issue and I will make it and add it.

## How to use
Each icons are contained in [`/icons/`](/icons/). To use an icons, you will need to copy the link first.

### Step 1. Get a link of icon
First, find and open the icon you want to use from [`/icons/`](/icons/).

Next, get a link of the image. A link can be gotten in the following two ways.
- Right click on the image and select `Copy image address`
  - The image will be copied in the format `https://github.com/taikun114/CasaOS-Custom-Icons-by-taikun114/blob/main/icons/App-Name/App-Name.png?raw=true`.
- Right click on the image and select `Open image in new tab`, then copy the URL in the tab opened
  - The image will be copied in the format `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taikun114/CasaOS-Custom-Icons-by-taikun114/refs/heads/main/icons/App-Name/App-Name.png`.

Both links you can get are different, but the result is the same. Copy the link using your preferred method.
